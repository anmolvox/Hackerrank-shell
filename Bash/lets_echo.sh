#Write a bash script which does just one thing: saying "HELLO".

#Input Format 
#There is no input file required for this problem.
#
#Output Format 
#HELLO
#
#Sample Output 
#HELLO
#
#A quick introduction to 'Echo' 
#This is the equivalent of common output commands in most programming language (print or puts statements).
#
#For Example:
#
#echo "Greetings"
#This outputs just one word "Greetings" (without the quotation marks).
#
#echo "Greetings $USER, your current working directory is $PWD"
#This picks up the values of the environment variables  and  and displays something like:
 echo "HELLO"
